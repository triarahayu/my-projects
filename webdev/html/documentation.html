                With the rising tide of steam power and machinery, who can come close to being a Beyonder? Shrouded in the fog of history and darkness, who or what is the lurking evil that murmurs into our ears? Waking up to be faced with a string of mysteries, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti in an alternate Victorian era world where he sees a world filled with machinery, cannons, dreadnoughts, airships, difference machines, as well as Potions, Divination, Hexes, Tarot Cards, Sealed Artifacts…
               </p>
                <p>
                    The Light continues to shine but the mystery has never gone far. Follow Klein as he finds himself entangled with the Churches of the world—both orthodox and unorthodox—while he slowly develops newfound powers thanks to the Beyonder potions. Like the corresponding tarot card, The Fool, which is numbered 0—a number of unlimited potentials—this is the legend of &quot;The Fool.&quot;

                <p>
                    Lord of the Mysteries novel is one of the most amazing novels I have ever read. It&apos;s my NUMBER ONE. It is different from typical Chinese novels filled with Cultivation, and systems
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is one of the most unique and bizarre novels. I started reading Lord of the Mysteries because of the multiple great reviews and I was not disappointed. Every time I finished reading a chapter, I was left wanting more. Two chapters daily were no way enough for me.

                <p>
                    You can say that the world setting is one of its strengths. The setting of the world is the Victorian era and it is done very masterfully. You can tell the author has done his research very well. The world that we see is similar to the modern world. There exist normal jobs, education gets encouraged, universities, police, inventions, churches, etc. Only with horse-drawn carriages, maidservants, top hats, and canes…
                </p>
                <p>
                    World history is immensely complicated. The story focuses on history as it plays an important part. DO NOT SKIP the history as one by one the author Cuttlefish That Loves Diving brings them back to life.

                <code>
                    Besides history, the author also focuses on economics. To obtain power in this world, you have to have enough money to purchase potion materials. Every character here focuses on earning money in one way or another.

                <p>
                    Lord of the Mysteries has the best Power System. The author has done yet again great work in Power Systems. This steampunk-set world has Beyonder who obtains powers using potions. They use Potions to obtain power from different pathways and to level up their sequences. Potions are made from ingredients i.e. from magical creatures, which are a very small part of the story. There are 22 pathways. Every single one has its own unique traits depending on the situation, and any one of them could be powerful depending on the use. The way how the names of the potion are thought and their power is designed is simply brilliant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowledge is power and as long as you have enough knowledge of your opponent&apos;s pathway you can almost always make a victory plan as long as the difference in the sequence isn&apos;t too big. Some pathways have a requirement for intelligence, like the lawyer, seer, and apprentice and some are pure instincts like the Luck and Devil pathway.

                <p>
                    The characters have their own personalities and are not there just to cheer the main character on, like in many other novels. The characters have their own personality, and beliefs, and work hard to get powerful and survive in that dangerous world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main character i.e Klein is not overpowered from the beginning but he does have a special power that helps him stay ahead of others but not by very much. The enemies that he faces are realistic for a fantasy world. The enemies are cunning and way ahead in terms of power. Klein uses his brain and tricks to win against them.
                </p>

                    Note: I have not mentioned many things such as Gods, spirits, Artifacts, rituals, etc. I hope you can go read the story and explore as well as discover the amazing yet bizarre world of Lord of Mysteries.
